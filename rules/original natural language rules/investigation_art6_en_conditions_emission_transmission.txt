1.  The issuing authority may only issue an EIO where the following conditions have been met:
	(a)  the  issuing of  the  EIO is  necessary and  proportionate for  the  purpose  of  the proceedings referred  to in  Article  4 taking into account the rights of the suspected or accused person; and
	(b)  the  investigative  measure(s) indicated in  the  EIO  could  have  been  ordered under the  same  conditions in  a  similar domestic case.
2.  The conditions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be assessed by the issuing authority in each case.
