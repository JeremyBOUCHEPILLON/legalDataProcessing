Article 13
Transfer of evidence
1.  The executing authority shall, without undue delay, transfer the evidence obtained or already in the possession of the competent authorities of the executing State as a result of the execution of the EIO to the issuing State.
Where requested in the EIO and if possible under the law of the executing State, the evidence shall be immediately transferred  to  the  competent  authorities  of  the  issuing State  assisting in  the  execution  of  the  EIO  in  accordance with Article 9(4).
2.  The  transfer of  the  evidence may  be  suspended, pending a  decision regarding  a  legal  remedy,  unless sufficient reasons are indicated in the EIO that an immediate transfer is essential for the proper conduct of its investigations or for the preservation of individual rights. However, the transfer of evidence shall be suspended if it would cause serious and irreversible damage to the person concerned.
3.  When transferring the evidence obtained, the executing authority shall indicate whether it requires the evidence to be returned to the executing State as soon as it is no longer required in the issuing State.
4.  Where the  objects, documents, or  data  concerned  are  already relevant for  other  proceedings, the  executing authority  may,  at  the  explicit request of  and  after  consultations with  the  issuing authority,  temporarily  transfer  the evidence on the condition that it be returned to the executing State as soon as it is no longer  required in the issuing State or at any other time or occasion agreed between the competent authorities.
