Article 7
Transmission of the EIO
1.  The EIO completed in accordance with Article 5 shall be transmitted from the issuing authority to the executing authority by any means capable of producing a written record under conditions allowing the executing State to establish authenticity.
2.  Any  further  official communication shall  be  made  directly between the  issuing authority  and  the  executing authority.
3.  Without prejudice to Article 2(d), each Member State may designate a central authority or, where its legal system so provides, more than one central authority, to assist the competent authorities. A Member State may, if necessary due to the organisation of its internal judicial system, make its central authority(ies) responsible for the administrative transmission and receipt of EIOs, as well as for other official correspondence relating to EIOs.
4.  The  issuing authority  may  transmit EIOs  via  the  telecommunications system of  the  European Judicial Network (EJN), as set up by Council Joint Action. 98/428/JHA (1).
5.  If  the  identity of  the  executing  authority  is  unknown,  the  issuing authority  shall  make  all  necessary  inquiries, including via the EJN contact points, in order to obtain the information from the executing State.
6.  Where the authority in the executing State which receives the EIO has no competence to recognise the EIO or to take  the  necessary  measures for  its  execution,  it  shall, ex  officio,   transmit the  EIO  to  the  executing  authority  and  so inform the issuing authority.
7.  All difficulties concerning the transmission or authenticity of any document needed for  the execution of the EIO shall  be  dealt  with  by  direct  contacts between the  issuing authority  and  the  executing  authority  involved  or,  where appropriate, with the involvement of the central authorities of the Member States.
