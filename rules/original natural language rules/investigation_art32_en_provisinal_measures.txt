Article 32
Provisional measures
1.  The issuing authority may issue an EIO in order to take any measure with a view to provisionally preventing the destruction, transformation, removal, transfer or disposal of an item that may be used as evidence.
2.  The executing authority shall decide and communicate the decision on the provisional measure as soon as possible and, wherever practicable, within 24 hours of receipt of the EIO.
3.  Where a provisional measure referred to in paragraph 1 is requested the issuing authority shall indicate in the EIO whether the  evidence is  to  be  transferred to  the  issuing State  or  is  to  remain in  the  executing  State.  The  executing authority shall recognise and execute the EIO and transfer the evidence in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Directive.
4.  Where, in accordance with paragraph 3, an EIO is accompanied by an instruction that the evidence shall remain in the executing State, the issuing authority shall indicate the date of  lifting the provisional measure referred to in paragraph 1, or the estimated date for the submission of the request for the evidence to be transferred to the issuing State.
5.  After consulting the issuing authority, the executing authority may, in accordance with its national law and practice, lay down appropriate conditions in light of the circumstances of the case to limit the period for which the proviÂ­sional measure referred to in paragraph 1 is to be maintained. If, in accordance with those conditions, it envisages lifting the provisional measure, the executing authority shall inform the issuing authority, which shall be given the opportunity to  submit its  comments. The  issuing authority  shall  forthwith notify the  executing authority  that  the  provisional measure referred to in paragraph 1 has been lifted.
